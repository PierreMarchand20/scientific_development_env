# My personal development environments [![Building Docker images](https://github.com/PierreMarchand20/scientific_development_env/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PierreMarchand20/scientific_development_env/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Eight environments are defined via Docker images with several MPI implementations compiled with gcc and clang:

- Ubuntu with `OpenMPI`
- Ubuntu with `MPICH`
- Debian with `OpenMPI`
- Debian with `MPICH`

These are for my personal use, but feel free to use it, and to look at it to build your own images. The Docker images can be pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pierremarchand/scientific_development_env).
